# Specs Meta

## Prime Directive
- Specs in /specs are the source of truth.
- Implement the smallest change that satisfies the spec.
- Keep changes reviewable.

## Security
- NEVER commit .env or API keys.
- Use .env.example only.
- Redact secrets in screenshots/logs.

## Minimal Success Criteria (Day 3)
- Clear functional + technical spec
- Skills are documented and testable
- CI exists and runs on push/PR
- REPORT.md explains the repo + workflow
